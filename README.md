## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

To run this documentation site on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Version 20.0 or higher is required. You can check your version with `node -v`. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.
* **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**: Used for managing dependencies.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aayushman-Gupta/yourDB-official-docs
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# OR if you prefer Yarn
# yarn install
```

### 4. 4. Run the Development Server
This command starts a local server (usually on http://localhost:3000) and opens the site in your browser. It automatically rebuilds the site when you make changes to the source files.

```bash
npm run start
# OR if you prefer Yarn
# yarn start
```

##  üõ†Ô∏è Building the Static Site
To generate the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for deployment, run the build command. The output will be placed in the build/ directory.

```bash
npm run build
# OR if you prefer Yarn
# yarn build
```
