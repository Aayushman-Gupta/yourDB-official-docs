# API Reference: YourDB Class

The `YourDB` class is the main entry point for interacting with your database. It manages entities (collections of objects) and provides methods for CRUD operations and database management.

```python
from yourdb import YourDB
```

## Initialization
```python
db = YourDB(db_name: str)
```

Creates or connects to a database instance.

-   **db_name (str)**: The name of the database. This determines the folder name used for storage (e.g., my_app_db.yourdb).

-   **Behavior**: If the database directory exists, it loads existing entities and their schemas. If not, it creates the directory.

---

##  Entity Management
`create entity`

```python
db.create_entity(entity_name: str, entity_schema: dict) -> bool
```

Creates a new entity (similar to a table or collection) within the database.

-   `entity_name` (str): The name for the new entity (alphanumeric and underscores, cannot start with a number).

-   `entity_schema` (dict): A dictionary defining the structure and types of objects stored in this entity. Must include:

-   '`primary_key'` (str): The name of the attribute serving as the unique identifier.

-   Attribute names mapped to type strings (e.g., `"int"`, `"str"`, `"bool"`, `"float"`, or the name of a `@register_class`-decorated class).

-   `'indexes'`: (Optional list of str) A list of attribute names to create indexes on for faster lookups.

-   Returns: `True` on success.

-   Raises: `Exception` if the entity name is invalid, the schema is invalid, or the entity already exists.


`drop entity`
```python
db.drop_entity(entity_name: str) -> bool
```

Permanently deletes an entity and all its associated data files. Use with caution!

-   `entity_name` (str): The name of the entity to delete.

-   **Returns**: `True` on success.

-   **Raises**: `Exception` if the entity does not exist.

##  Data Operations

`insert_into`

```python
db.insert_into(entity_name: str, entity_object: object) -> bool
```

Inserts a new object record into the specified entity.

-   `entity_name` (str): The name of the target entity.

-   `entity_object` (object): An instance of a Python class (usually decorated with `@register_class`) whose attributes match the entity's schema. The primary key attribute must be set before calling insert.

-  ** Returns**: `True` on success.

-   **Raises** : `Exception` if the entity doesn't exist, the object fails schema validation (e.g., wrong type, missing primary key), or the primary key already exists.


`select_from`

```python
db.select_from(entity_name: str, filter_dict: dict = None) -> list[object]
```

Retrieves a list of objects from an entity that match the specified filter.

-   `entity_name` (str): The name of the entity to query.

-   `filter_dict` (Optional dict): A dictionary specifying the query conditions.

    -   Keys are attribute names.

    -   Values are either the exact value to match or a nested dictionary with operators (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$ne`, etc.). [See Advanced Queries](/docs/tutorials/advanced-queries).

    -   If `None` or omitted, returns all objects in the entity.

**Returns**: A list of reconstructed Python objects matching the filter. Returns an empty list if no matches are found.

**Raises**: `Exception` if the entity does not exist.

`update_entity`
