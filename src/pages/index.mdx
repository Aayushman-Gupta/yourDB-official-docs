  <h1>yourdb</h1>
  <p>A modern, developer-friendly database built in pure Python.</p>
  <p>Persist complex, nested class objects directly without ORMs or manual serialization.</p>
</div>

`yourdb` is a new, object-native database designed to feel native to Python. It combines the speed of an in-memory cache with the durability of a log-structured file system, all while providing advanced features like thread-safety, schema evolution, and time-travel.

## Core Features

-   ðŸš€ **Object-Native Persistence**: Your classes *are* the database. Store and retrieve your Python objects directly.
-   ðŸ§¬ **Hybrid Schema Evolution**: Evolve your data classes over time without risky migration scripts, using a powerful lazy-read and eager-migration model.
-   âš¡ **High-Performance & Thread-Safe**: A log-structured engine for fast writes and a writer-preference lock for robust concurrency.
-   ðŸ§  **Advanced Querying**: Go beyond simple lookups with operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, and `$ne`.

## Installation

Get started in seconds. `yourdb` is available on PyPI.

```bash
pip install yourdb-engine  # <-- Replace with your actual PyPI name
